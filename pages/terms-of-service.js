                <br/><br/>
                <b>5.</b> Access, usage rules and enforcement<br/>
                <b>5.1.</b> The Client only acquires a license to use the Applications. The parties explicitly do
                not intend to transfer any intellectual or industrial property rights. The right of use is
                non-transferable and non-exclusive. Any hosting of the data is provided by Go Forensics or by the
                Client or a Third Party designated by the Client.<br/>
                <b>5.2.</b> The Client is only permitted to use the Applications in accordance with the agreed
                license conditions.<br/>
                <b>5.3.</b> The Client is responsible for any use of the Applications. All acts that can be traced
                back to the Client, regardless of whether they have been performed by the Client, the Client's
                employees or persons affiliated with it or Third Parties are attributed to the Client.<br/>
                <b>5.4.</b> The Applications may not be used in violation of the law, the Agreement, these terms and
                conditions and the terms and conditions of Third Parties including Go Forensics whether the
                Client is dependent for the use of the Applications.<br/>

                apply.<br/>
                <b>5.6.</b> When using the Applications, the Client may not infringe any intellectual property right
                or other right of Go Forensics or a Third Party.<br/>
                <b>5.7.</b> It is not permitted to copy parts of the Applications and/or their content, except to
                the extent necessary to consult the Applications and/or their content in an efficient manner (via
                the internet) and to use them for the purposes of the license permitted use.<br/>
                <b>5.8.</b> In the event that Go Forensics observes any improper behavior on the part of the
                Client or of a User for which the Client is or can be held responsible, Go Forensics is entitled
                to immediately and without further notice deny the access to data of the Client and/or the User or
                for a Go Forensics to be determined time and to delete the content and/or other data. In doing
                so, the blocked person loses all his or her rights with regard to the Applications, without being
                entitled to compensation. Improper conduct includes (but is not limited to) conduct in violation of
                the law, the Agreement, these terms and conditions, the license terms and otherwise improper
                conduct.<br/>
                <b>5.9.</b> In the event that Go Forensics observes any improper behavior on the part of the

                entitled to dissolve the Agreement without further prior warning and without judicial intervention.
                In that case, the Client is liable for the minimum compensation for the amount not yet paid by the
                Client Go Forensics paid claims arising from the Agreement for the current calendar year that
                Go Forensics is owed. Any fees paid will not be refunded by Go Forensics. This paragraph does
                not affect the possibility for Go Forensics to recover the full damage from the Client.<br/>
                <b>5.10.</b> By Go Forensics cannot be required to form an opinion on the merits of the claims of
                Third Parties or of the Client's defense or to be involved in any way in a dispute between a Third
                Party and the Client. The Client will have to agree with the relevant Third Party in this regard and
                Go Forensics fully and unconditionally indemnify in this regard.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>6.</b> Control and advertising period<br/>
                <b>6.1.</b> The Client must inspect the services (including any implementation work or software
                delivered) regularly and at least immediately upon commencement and immediately after the end of the
                work or upon completion or delivery, respectively. Visible or otherwise reasonably recognizable
                defects, bugs or deviations from what has been agreed upon must be notified in writing immediately
                after the inspection, but in any case within 3 working days after the end of the work.
                Go Forensics is to be notified.<br/>
                <b>6.2.</b> If the Client does not have sufficient expertise, he is obliged to be assisted or
                represented by an expert during the inspection.<br/>
                <b>6.3.</b> Other defects or deviations from what has been agreed must be reported by the Client in
                writing within 3 working days after their discovery to Go Forensics.<br/>
                <b>6.4.</b> If the Client fails to deliver within the periods referred to in this article,
                Go Forensics by informing him in writing of the defect, he loses the right to invoke any legal
                consequences arising from the defect or deviation from what has been agreed.<br/>
                <b>6.5.</b> Minor deviations from specified sizes, functionality, layout, design, compositions or
                colors or other deviations, as a result of which no substantial change is made in the composition,
                execution or applicability of the Applications, or a defect that could have been known (whether or
                not not after inspection in accordance with this article) give the Client neither the right to
                cancellation or (partial) dissolution of the Agreement, nor the right to refuse receipt or payment
                of the goods or services.<br/>
                <b>6.6.</b> If a performance is defective and a complaint has been made in time, Go Forensics will
                carry out or repair the defective performance again within a reasonable period of time and without
                defects. Go Forensics is also entitled to pay replacement compensation to the Client up to a
                maximum of the invoice amount of the relevant performance for a period of one month.<br/>
                <b>6.7.</b> If a complaint is unfounded, the costs incurred as a result will be added by
                Go Forensics integrally at the expense of the Client.<br/>
                <b>6.8.</b> Complaints do not entitle the Client to suspend or reduce its obligations under the
                Agreement. Go Forensics is not liable for damage as a result of defects in the delivered
                performance.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>7.</b> Payment and due date<br/>
                <b>7.1.</b> Unless otherwise agreed in writing, payment without suspension and/or set-off must be
                made by bank in euros within 14 days of the invoice date.<br/>
                <b>7.2.</b> If payment has not been made within the agreed payment term, the Client will owe
                interest from the date of expiry of the payment term. The interest is 10% per
                year, but is equal to the statutory commercial interest (6:119a Dutch Civil Code) if this is higher.<br/>
                <b>7.3.</b> The Client is liable for all actual by Go Forensics (judicial and extrajudicial)
                costs incurred relating to the collection of its claims against the Client, with a minimum of 15% of
                the outstanding amount and € 250.00 per invoice.<br/>
                <b>7.4.</b> Regardless of the agreed payment conditions, the Client is obliged at the request of
                Go Forensics to provide, in its opinion, sufficient security for payment. If the Client does not
                comply with this request within the stipulated period, it will immediately be in default.
                Go Forensics in that case, it has the right to dissolve the Agreement and to recover its damage from
                the Client.<br/>
                <b>7.5.</b> The Client's right to enforce its claims against Go Forensics to be set off against
                payment obligations to Go Forensics is excluded for whatever reason.<br/>
                <b>7.6.</b> Under no circumstances is the Client entitled to suspend any obligation.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>8.</b> Changes and Adjustments<br/>
                <b>8.1.</b> Go Forensics is entitled to unilaterally change or adapt these general terms and
                conditions and the composition, content and form of the Applications.<br/>
                <b>8.2.</b> Go Forensicsis is entitled to unilaterally adjust the prices annually at the
                beginning of each calendar year. In addition, Go Forensics is entitled in the event of an
                adjustment of the cost-determining factors, such as personnel costs, and fees, taxes and premiums
                determined by and on behalf of the government, to implement a proportional adjustment of the prices
                and rates used with immediate effect.<br/>
                <b>8.3.</b> If a non-subordinate change or adjustment is not acceptable to the Client, the Client
                has the right to terminate the Agreement, effective on the effective date of the non-subordinate
                change or adjustment. Termination can only be done in writing. A price increase up to and including
                10% is a minor change.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>9.</b> Force of the majority<br/>
                <b>9.1.</b> In case of force majeure, both permanent and temporary, Go Forensics at its own
                discretion, is entitled to dissolve the Agreement in whole or in part or to temporarily suspend its
                obligations under the Agreement, without the Client being able to assert any claim to performance,
                compensation and/or dissolution.<br/>
                <b>9.2.</b> Force majeure means between the parties, in addition to what is understood about it in
                the law and jurisprudence, all external causes, foreseen or unforeseen, to which Go Forensics
                cannot exert any influence, but through which Go Forensicsis is unable to meet its obligations.
                This includes (but is not limited to): (work) strikes in the company of Go Forensics, from the
                Client or from Third Parties whose Go Forensics is in any way dependent for the execution of the
                Agreement, danger of war, war, insurrection, molestation, boycott, disruptions or impediments in
                traffic or transport, restrictive measures by government, scarcity of raw materials, untimely
                delivery of raw materials or other failure to deliver, bankruptcy or suspension of payment at one or
                more of its suppliers or third parties engaged, natural disasters, weather conditions as a result of
                which the work cannot be performed adequately, electricity failures, failure of the internet,
                computer network or telecommunications facilities and impeding health complaints or death of key
                personnel of Go Forensics (including – but not limited to – its director(s)).<br/>
                <b>9.3.</b> Go Forensics also has the right to invoke force majeure if the circumstance that
                prevents (further) fulfillment of the Agreement occurs after Go Forensics should have fulfilled
                his obligation.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>10.</b> Right of retention<br/>
                <b>10.1.</b> When Go Forensics has in possession of the Client's goods, is Go Forensics
                entitled to retain these goods until all claims have been made that Go Forensics at that time
                against the Client, including, but not limited to, claims arising from this Agreement, any other
                Agreement and claims under the law.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>11.</b> Availability and Reliance on Third Parties<br/>
                although Go Forensics does everything reasonably possible, Go Forensics cannot guarantee that
                the Applications are always complete, correct, accurate or up-to-date, or that the Applications are
                always online and available or that the Applications are suitable for the purpose for which the
                Client and/or User wishes to use them. Go Forensics makes every effort to treat all comments
                regarding the Applications seriously and where Go Forensics considers it necessary to make
                improvements. Any inaccuracies can be reported via the e-mail address of
                info@goforensics.io.<br/>
                <b>11.1.</b> Go Forensics is entitled to temporarily shut down its Applications, including (but
                not limited to) taking them offline, for maintenance, updates or for any other reason.
                Go Forensics will make every effort to do this outside office hours as much as possible.<br/>
                <b>11.2.</b> Go Forensics does not warrant that the Applications are always free from malicious
                computer code and/or intrusions, such as (but not limited to) viruses, worms and Trojan horses. The
                Client and User must ensure that the network (or system) of the Client and User and the devices
                connected to it are adequately protected against such undesirables.<br/>
                <b>11.3.</b> For offering the Applications is Go Forensics dependent to some extent on Third
                Parties, such as (but not limited to) the software supplier for the Applications, hosting partners,
                Internet Service Providers and network administrators. These Third Parties may set their own terms
                and conditions for the use of the services they offer Go Forensics, the Client and/or the User.
                Go Forensics cannot guarantee the availability and use of the services of Third Parties and the
                possible consequences of the wholly or temporarily not or not adequately offering the services by
                Third Parties and the non-acceptance by Third Parties of input (in the broadest sense of the word)
                of Go Forensics, the Client or the User. The applicable terms and conditions of Third Parties are
                available for inspection by the Client at the office of Go Forensics and will be sent free of
